 2.2        I observed that the Primary Frequency is 440 Hz which were indicated by yellow lines. The darker regions in the spectrogram indicate low frequency components of a keystroke.According to what I observed,Among all the regions yellow coloured lines indicate high frequency components of a keystroke, orange ones indicate frequencies less that that of yellow lines and purple lines indicate much less frequency components. I observed that when there are frequency components of the next key stroke, the lower frequency components of the present keystroke still persist. I also observed that when there were no yellow, orange lines I couldn't hear any sound from the wave file.
